# Surfs_up,
Exploring Weather Data by the use of SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database, analyzing data with Python (Pandas functions and methods), plotting graphs with Matplotlib comprehensive library and building a Climate App Using Flask.

Results: 

The purpose of this project  was to create a strong business plan which will rely on our Weather Data Analysis as key information to potential Inverstors for "Surf and Shake" shop in Oahu, Hawaii serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists and you reading this github repository.

Specifically, for this analysis, we want to focus on temperature trend data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the "Surf and Shake" shop business is sustainable year-round.

Analysis :
* Import dependencies and set up a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper
* Write a query that filters the date column from the Measurement table to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December
* Convert the temperatures to a list
* Create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures
* Generate the summary statistics for the June and December temperatures DataFrame
